## Hi there 👋

Hey there! 👋 I’m a Python developer with a passion for automation and efficiency—especially when it comes to working with spreadsheets. This repository showcases my ongoing work in automating Excel and Google Sheets workflows to save time, reduce manual errors, and streamline repetitive data tasks.

Spreadsheets are powerful tools, but managing them manually can quickly become tedious and error-prone. That’s where Python comes in. I’ve been building scripts and small-scale tools that handle everything from data cleaning and formatting to advanced reporting and integration with external APIs—all directly from or to Excel and Google Sheets.

In this repo, you’ll find code examples, utilities, and real-world use cases that demonstrate how to automate routine spreadsheet operations using libraries like pandas, openpyxl, xlwings, and gspread. Whether it's generating dynamic reports, merging datasets, updating sheets in real-time, or setting up automated alerts, my goal is to make working with data smoother and smarter.

I’m constantly learning and refining these scripts to make them more modular, flexible, and user-friendly. I believe in writing clean, well-documented code that others can easily understand and adapt for their own needs. If you're someone who works with spreadsheets regularly—or you're just curious about what’s possible with a bit of Python—you’ll hopefully find something useful here.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute. I always welcome feedback and collaboration from fellow developers and data enthusiasts.

Thanks for visiting! Let’s make spreadsheet work a little less manual, and a lot more automated. 🐍📊⚙️
